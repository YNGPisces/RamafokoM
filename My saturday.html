    <p>My saturday wasn`t as I expected it to be,infact it was quite the opposite.I expected it to be the one day of the week that I could actually relax and prolong all my home-works to sunday.But I guess life had other plans.On saturday morning I woke up to brush my teeth,wash the dishes,mop the floors and take a bath,that was the end of it or atleast that`s what I thought.Thats when my grandmother called and asked me to come to help with a few errands,she asked me to help clean the garage and throw away the useless objects,three hours after we had started we came across a snake in the garage luckily it was already dead,you could imagine the far in my grandmothers face when we found it.After cleaning the garage she vowed that she would always clean the garage every single month to make sure that something like that doesn`t happen again.I immidiately went home afterwards thinking that i`d actually relax a bit but that`s when my moter told me to to clean the dishes before eating and going to sleep so to sum it up my saturday was a frightning,exhausting and hellish nightmare that I hope would never come again. </p>
